# credit_card_fraud_detection
A credit card fraud detection system in Machine Learning.  
For this project, we will be using the several methods of the Anomaly detection with Probability Densities.

Algorithms implemented:
1. A local out wire factor to calculate anomaly scores.
2. Isolation forced algorithm. 

To get started we will first build a dataset of over 280,000 credit card transactions to work on!

You can download this data set from Kaggle.com, it is named as Credit Card Fraud Detection.
